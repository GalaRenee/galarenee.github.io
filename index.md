## CPSC 120

* Lab 1

I liked the first lab because it was quick and simple and it was a nice introductory to getting used to the program and figuring out how to code something for the first time. It was a good way to get to know how the labs work and what is expected of us to get them done properly. I was able to learn how create a simple code for the first time and work my way around the program. 

* Lab 7

I liked lab 7, part 1 because it was interesting to see how you code a calendar especially taking into account that the program expects two dates from the Gregorian Calendar. It was also cool because this was code that had real world implications to it and it’s fun to see how something we use everyday works. I was able to learn how to code the date and to know what things to keep in mind to do it properly. 

* Lab 12 

I liked lab 12 the most, especially part 1 because this is one the aspects of computer science that I love learning about especially because I have a background in art and animation. I’m very interested in Ux/ Ui design and front end software development so this lab was right up my alley of something I wanted to gain a better understanding of. I was able to learn how to create images, animations and how to manipulate color all through coding.
