* Lab 1

I liked the first lab because it was quick and simple and it was a nice introductory to getting used to the program and figuring out how to code something for the first time. It was a good way to get to know how the labs work and what is expected of us to get them done properly. 

* Lab 7

I liked lab 7, part 1 because it was interesting to see how you code a calendar especially taking into account that the program expects two dates from the Gregorian Calendar. It was also cool because this was code that had real world implications to it and it’s fun to see how something we use everyday works. 

* Lab 12 

I liked lab 12 the most, especially part 1 because this is one the aspects of computer science that I love learning about especially because I have a background in art and animation. I’m very interested in Ux/ Ui design and front end software development so this lab was right up my alley of something I wanted to gain a better understanding of.
